VizImmune: a platform for visualising in-host immune kinetics.

## About The Project

![Screenshot](results/vizimmune_screenshot.png)

VizImmune: an open-source platform to harness the scientific public health potential of immunological biomarker data. Immunological biomarkers are measurable indicators of the immune systemâ€™s response to various diseases, infections and vaccination. By systematically collecting and analysing these data, public health officials can gain a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases on the individual and population level in several ways:

* First, it helps in disease surveillance and outbreak detection, as immunological biomarker data allows health authorities to identify the presence of infectious diseases, track their spread, and implement timely interventions such as quarantine measures of targeted vaccination campaigns

* Second, these data can aid in assessing the effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination programmes, evaluate their impact and make evidence-based decisions regarding future strategies. 

* Finally, immunological biomarker data plays a crucial role in vaccine development and monitoring; it helps researchers understand the immune response to different vaccines, identify correlates of protection and identify surrogate endpoints to help supplement long and expensive clinical trials.
